# My School Projects Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of my university coursework projects, organized by class.  
It showcases my programming, software development, and systems skills through a variety of projects, simulations, and assignments.

## Projects Overview

### 200 Projects – Introduction to Low-Level Programming
- Projects focused on **MIPS assembly and low-level programming concepts**.
- Includes assignments in MIPS and Assembly to build foundational CS skills.

### 212 Projects – Web Development
- Introductory HTML and web development projects.
- Demonstrates basic website creation, layout, and interactivity.

### 249 Projects – Data Structures
- Implemented **core data structures and algorithms** in C and Python.
- Includes linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and other fundamental structures.

### 450 Projects – Parallel Programming
- Assignments using **OpenMP, pthreads, and multi-threaded programming**.
- Projects emphasize concurrency, synchronization, and performance optimization.

### 470 Projects – Introduction to AI
- Projects centered around **artificial intelligence concepts**.
- Includes route-finding algorithms and simple game AI implementations.

### 480 Projects – Operating Systems
- Four simulation projects (Sim_1 to Sim_4) demonstrating:
  - **Process scheduling, memory management, preemption**
  - Multi-threading and OS-level simulations
- Focus on practical OS concepts applied in C.

## Skills & Technologies
- Programming Languages: **C, Python, Assembly (MIPS), HTML/CSS**
- Tools & Concepts: Git, GitHub, Makefiles, Visual Studio Code, OpenMP, pthreads, Operating Systems, AI Algorithms, Data Structures
- Version Control & Large Files: Git LFS for tracking large simulation files

## How to Run
- Some projects include scripts, `.exe` files, or configuration files.
- If help is needed to run the porjects just ask and I can help with that
- Large files are tracked using Git LFS.
